# 🌦️ Weather App
Weather App is a simple, responsive web application that allows users to check current weather conditions and 3-day forecasts for any city, or based on their current location using the Geolocation API. It fetches real-time weather data from the WeatherAPI and presents it in a clean, user-friendly interface.

## 🧠 How It Works
- When the page loads, the browser requests the user's location using navigator.geolocation.

- If access is granted, weather data is fetched based on latitude and longitude.

- Users can also manually search for a city using the input field.

- Weather data is then parsed and displayed with proper formatting using JavaScript.
